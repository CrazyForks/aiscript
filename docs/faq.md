## Why AiScript

In the past decades, web applications are built using server-side programming languages such as PHP, Java, Python, Ruby, etc. Each language has its web frameworks, ORMs, template engines, etc.
Programmers have to learn different languages and frameworks to build web applications. However, each web framework and ORM essentially does the same thing. They all parse HTTP requests, execute SQL queries, and response the result wit JSON or render HTML templates. There is no need to learn different languages and frameworks to build web applications. So we built AiScript to make web development easier.
